Installed and configured Ubuntu within a virtualized environment to establish a Linux foundation for subsequent labs.

### Lab 2 — Creating and Using Virtual Machines

Provisioned and managed virtual machines, including resource configuration and connectivity testing.

### Lab 3 — Virtual Networks

Configured virtual networking to enable communication between machines and explored IP addressing concepts.

### Lab 4 — Securing Networks

Applied firewall rules and access controls to strengthen network security within the virtual environment.

### Lab 5–6 — Introduction to AWS

Explored AWS console navigation and provisioned foundational resources to understand core cloud service models.

### Lab 7 — Apache Web Server on AWS

Deployed and configured an Apache web server using EC2 instances and validated remote access.

### Lab 8 — DNS & SSL

Configured domain resolution and explored HTTPS encryption concepts to secure web communication.

### Lab 9 — Amazon RDS

Provisioned and connected to managed database services using Amazon RDS.

### Lab 10 — Elastic Beanstalk

Deployed applications using AWS Elastic Beanstalk to understand platform-managed hosting environments.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1 — LAMP Stack & WordPress Deployment

Installed and configured a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) within a virtual machine and deployed a WordPress CMS instance. Firewall rules were applied to enhance system security.

### Assignment 2 — Load Balancing & Auto Scaling

Implemented scalable cloud infrastructure using Elastic Load Balancing and Auto Scaling concepts to understand traffic distribution and high availability.
