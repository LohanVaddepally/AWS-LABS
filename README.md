# AWS-LABS
# Cloud Infrastructure Labs Portfolio

This repository contains hands-on labs and assignments completed as part of my practical learning in virtualization, networking, and cloud infrastructure using Ubuntu, AWS, and related technologies. These exercises were focused on building foundational knowledge in system deployment, networking configuration, security controls, and scalable cloud application hosting.

The labs progress from local virtual machine environments to cloud-based infrastructure, demonstrating the transition from traditional system administration to cloud platform operations.

## Technologies Used

* Ubuntu Linux
* Virtual Machines
* Virtual Networking
* AWS EC2
* RDS
* Elastic Beanstalk
* DNS & SSL configuration
* Apache Web Server
* LAMP Stack
* WordPress Deployment
* Elastic Load Balancing
* Auto Scaling

## Lab Modules

Each lab folder includes configuration steps, screenshots, and notes documenting the implementation and learning outcomes.

This portfolio reflects my continued development toward cloud and infrastructure engineering roles.
